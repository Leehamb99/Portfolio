      My name is Liam, A junior software engineer and tech enthusiast. If you've taken the time to check out my projects page you'll already know of the technologies I'm familiar with; so no boring lists of endless technologies that I may have worked with once upon a time.

      The junior tech market is heavily saturated currently, so why me, A candidate without a degree and an untraditional route into the ever expanding universe of tech. The start of this untraditional journey stemmed from the soul crushing loss of my mother when I was 10. Sparing you of the details, I was dealt a fairly short straw in life and
      academia was unfortunately not a main focus of mine throughout adoslesence despite being a very promising student. Financial implications led to me working alongside my father, working as a garderner/landscaper once able to, instead of being able to pursue my own career. Fast-foward to today, I'm 24 and insanely motivated to work in such a fascinating field, as opposed to working ON unfascinating fields.

      I am certainly an open-minded individual in combination with natural analytical skills which I feel makes me well suited for this field in particular, as there is always a constant aim for efficiency. My numerical abilities - especially mental, have fortunately been of a high calibre since I was young, enabling me to keep the same pace should numbers be involved. This portfolio site was developed by myself after only being introduced to web development 4 months ago, to me that is a huge achievement and hopefully highlights my work ethic and innate ability to grasp new technologies.
